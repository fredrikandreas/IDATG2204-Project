- Database Implementation: Implement the designed database schema using a relational database management system (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite) to store and retrieve data efficiently. Implement the concepts learned in the course including primary/foreign/compositive keys, integrity/referential constraints, and others.
- Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation covering the database schema, backend APIs, frontend components, and instructions for running and testing the website (with screenshots). Choose the primary and foreign keys and mention your assumptions in the report.
